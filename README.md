# Semi_Supervised_Weed_Detection
#Introduction
This repository contains the implementation of various semi-supervised learning approaches for weed detection in sesame crop fields. The project was developed as part of the Semi-Supervised Weed Detection Challenge organized by 4i Labs, KRITI'25, IITG.

We aim to improve weed detection accuracy while minimizing the need for large labeled datasets. The challenge requires leveraging a small labeled dataset alongside a larger pool of unlabeled images to train an object detection model effectively.
